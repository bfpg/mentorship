BFPG Mentorships
================

Statement of purpose
--------------------

BFPG acknowledges the diversity of FP knowledge and skills among
BFPG attendees and others, and the desire of BFPG attendees and
others to increase their knowledge and develop their skills.

Accordingly, the BFPG Mentorships program ("the program") is
established to facilitate mentorships for the growth and development
of mentees *in a specific FP-related area*, and for the development
of mentorship and teaching skills in both mentors and mentees, and,
secondarily, to strengthen personal relationships among BFPG
attendees and between BFPG attendees and other sections of the
community.


Administration
--------------

Seeking a mentor or mentee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A forum will be established through which people can seek mentorship
on a particular topic.  If a mentor is not forthcoming, efforts will
be made to find one on behalf of the seeker.

People may also offer mentorship on a particular topic.  Unlike
people seeking a mentor, if no mentee is forthcoming, an effort will
not be made on behalf of the prospective mentor to find one.

Mentorships are entered into voluntarily by both the mentor and the
mentee.  No circumstance compels any person to commence a mentorship
with any other person.

The BFPG Mentorships program is open to all people, on the condition
that either the mentor or the mentee, or both, is affiliated with
BFPG [TODO define "affiliated with" precisely].  Non-programmers and
programmers wanting to learn FP are encouraged to seek mentorships.

[TODO: age restrictions as an arse-covering exercise?  Or what are
the administrative implications if the program is open to minors?)


Public record of mentorships
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A public record of mentorships established under the BFPG
Mentorships program shall be maintained.


Mentorship period
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The *formal* mentorship period shall be a duration between two and
twelve weeks agreed between the mentor and mentee when establishing
the mentorship.  At the end of this period, the formal mentorship
*concludes* and assessments and evaluations fall due.  Ongoing
mentorship beyond the formal mentorship is welcomed but is not part
of the BFPG Mentorships program.

[note: I (Fraser) think agreed duation is a good idea to make sure
that there is a definite point at which progress toward goals can be
assessed, and reflection to occur and feedback shared between mentor
and mentee.  Otherwise... when?]

[note: 12 weeks chosen as max duration as balance between not being
huge impost on mentor and freeing them up for other mentorships, and
reasonable mentorships a person might seek e.g. cis194.  min 2 weeks
chosen because that seemed like a sensible time for some short
mentorships e.g. presentation work etc... perhaps it should be 1mth.
Both upper and lower bound should be discussed!]


Establishing a mentorship
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To establish a mentorship, a mentor and mentee must:

- Discuss, agree and document specific goal(s) and expectations for
  the mentorship;

- Agree on the duration of the mentorship;

- Loosely agree on how frequently to meet during the mentorship, and
  the duration, location and format of those meetings;

- Notify BFPG of the commencement, topic and duration of the
  mentorship and update notice boards, etc.



Obligations during the mentorship
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Mentors and mentees must meet during the mentorship.  The mentor
must advise and support the mentee as they transparently work toward
the goal(s) of the mentorship.

Mentors are mentees are encouraged to privately or publically
document progress, struggles and successes throughout the
mentorship.


Assessments and evaluations at conclusion of mentorship
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the conclusion of the formal mentorship mentors and mentees must:

- Meet to jointly assess, discuss and document the progress made
  toward the goal(s) of the mentorship, reflecting on factors that
  may have led to the goal(s) being achieved or not yet achieved.


Mentees should:

- Independently evaluate the mentoring they received, outlining what
  was helpful and what the mentor might be considered to improve the
  effectiveness of their mentoring.  Share and discuss the feedback
  with your mentor.


Mentors must:

- Taking into account progress made, suggest further learning or
  work for the mentee in the topic of the mentorship.


[TODO: we should have templates for declaring goals and assessing
completion / progress ; and templates for providing feedback to
mentor / mentee]


Terminating a mentorship
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A mentorship may be terminated prior to its agreed conclusion
unilaterally by either the mentor or mentee, with or without
explanation, by informing the other person and BFPG.

People who terminate multiple mentorships without reasonable
explanation may be excluded from further participation in the
program.


Example mentorship topics
-------------------------

- Mentorship in turning code / ideas into a presentation or workshop
  (for BFPG, a conference, your workplace, anywhere!)

- Learning a particular theory, language, tool or library (use or
  internals)
  - Nix, lens, argonaut, Swift/swiftz, Ur, category theory,
    dependent types etc.

- Mentoring new contributors to an existing project
  - Existing contributors may seek to mentor new contributors
  - Non-contributors with seek to become contributors under the
    mentorship of an existing contributor
